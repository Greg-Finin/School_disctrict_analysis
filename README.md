# School District Analysis 
## Overview
For this project we were given information regarding the schools in a district. One file contained the school specific information, such as total number of students, budget, and school type. The other file contained the names and grades of all the students that attended the schools on our first list. We were tasked with using this data to display various dataframes, that represented important information, such as the average grades for students in each school, grade, etc. 
## Results
The project started with us reviewing the data, and we quickly saw that there were errors that needed cleaning. We had to remove the prefixes and suffixes from students names, as well as remove all of the data from the Thomas High School 9th grade class, as it had been tampered with. This resulted in a change in the overall district and school summary, as the numbers were changed. 
### School Summary
The most obvious change is seen through the replacing of Thomas High School Data. When we started, the percentages for students passing math, reading, and both math and reading were skewed, due to an error in the data. We were tasked with going in and cleaning that data, so that we could get a more accurate picture. The two images below show the change in the percentages, the top one being before, the bottom one being after. We saw over 10% increases in all aforementioned categories.
